Game Summary:
This is a simple command-line game about placing conveyer belt tracks to bring
the factory items from the source to the finish.

Purpose:
The purpose of this game is for me to learn how to code in C++. The game will
probably suck.

How the game will work:
The left side of the screen will be the actual level, which is where the tracks
and the items are. The right side of the screen will be the GUI that tells you
what types of tracks you can place, what track is currently selected, and what
is under the cursor.

There will be a controllable cursor to place and delete tracks. Since the
cursor will be an X over whatever the cursor is selecting, you cannot see what
is under the cursor, so there will be a UI element to the side that tells you
whatever is under the cursor.

Since this is a command-line game, the screen will be static and the player will
input text.
